# CapstoneProject1_Pet_Product_Auto-Subcategorizasion_by_Review_Analysis
Project Title: 
Pet Product Subcategorization by Review Analysis

**< Abstract >**  
20,403 pet products were subcategorized into the three-level nested categories (Animal category, Big category, and Small category) by hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This project includes data acquisition, data preprocessing, EDA, and clustering.  
  
The result of this project can be used for product classifications on the website of an e-commerce company and for extracting a specific group of products to analyze them closely; for example, the variety, popular products in the group, consumer needs, and others.
